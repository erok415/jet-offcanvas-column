For mobile devices, the entire column/container will be replaced with an Expand button. Clicking this button will slide the hidden content into the viewport.

A Collapse button will be automatically added to the top of the column/container content, which hides the content from view when clicked. **Optionally**, you can make any element work as a Collapse button by adding the `offcanvas-collapse` class to it. This optional class will work when you click directly on the element with this class or on a button inside that element.
